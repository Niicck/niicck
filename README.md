### Hi there üëã

Good tidings and welcome to my github profile.

I have a blog. It's called [supergood.site](https://supergood.site). I write about software dev things that I'm working on. There are also pretty pictures.

Latest Article! [Django + Vue Experiments Part 2: Vuetify](https://supergood.site/tech/django-vue-vuetify/).

**Are you here because of django-vite stuff?**

Look no further than:
- [django-vite](https://github.com/MrBin99/django-vite) -- a tremendous library to help you load vite assets into your Django site.
- [django-vite-examples](https://github.com/niicck/django-vite-examples) -- a set of demo apps to help get you started.

**Are you here because of Django + Vue stuff?**

My new hobby! I just love melding together irreconcilable frontend frameworks.

Take a look at:
- [Django + Vue Experiements](https://supergood.site/tech/series/django-vue-experiements/) -- my blog series documenting the ways I'm using Vue in Django templates.
- [supergood-reads](https://github.com/Niicck/supergood-reads) -- A demo site built in Vue + Django that mashes together goodreads & letterboxd & friends to create a one-stop shop for critiquing any and all media types.

**Are you here because of civic tech stuff?**

I've no longer in the scene professionally, but I like keeping tabs on what's happening. I'm happy to share about my experience to anyone who's interested. Long Live the Odd Flock üêîüíú.

Here's a sample of projects that I worked on at the City of Austin:
- [Publisher](https://github.com/niicck/coa-publisher) -- A delightfully overengineered static site builder (builder).
- [Janis](https://github.com/Niicck/janis) -- whaaaa dontchu take it
- [Joplin](https://github.com/Niicck/joplin) -- takea notha lil pizza my heart bby
- [Formstack Alpha Theme](https://github.com/Niicck/formstack-alpha-theme) -- I'm proud of this.

**Are you here because of ansible + dokku stuff?**

*"Save tens of dollars every year!"*

- [Infraestructura](https://github.com/Niicck/infraestructura) -- this is how I deploy all of my personal projects. And how you too can deploy all of my personal projects, I guess.

**Are you here but you'd rather be off the internet and actually engaged with the world?**

Check out some of the local theater in the Austin area!
